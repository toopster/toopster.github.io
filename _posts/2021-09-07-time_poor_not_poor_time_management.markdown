One thing that I have learnt from from my professional career to-date is that time is never on your side.  Technical projects in the real world are rarely delivered as perfectly as you plan or hope them to be.  Hopefully with this blog post I can share some tips, technical and not-so technical, 

## Google is your friend (and foe)

## Don't be afraid to ask for help

## Simple solutions are fast and cost effective

But they won't necessarily expand your coding skills.
