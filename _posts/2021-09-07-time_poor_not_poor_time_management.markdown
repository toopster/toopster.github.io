One thing that I have learnt from from my professional career to-date is that time is never on your side and that technical projects in the real world are rarely delivered as perfectly as you plan or hope them to be.  In this blog post I share some tips, technical and not-so technical, obvious and not-so obvious, from my working in industry.

As I did my usual staring at a blank screen before starting this blog post, I reflected on some of the different projects that I have worked on throughout my career and how I might have done them differently had I known at the start of the project what I knew at the end.  Indeed one of the digital agencies that I used to work with would tell me that, you can have the best requirements gathering processes and functional specifications, you never really discover the full project brief until it is delivered.

More than anything, the commodity of time was always in short supply. From the project where my team and I delivered an enterprise level entry, logging and judging platform for an Awards company in a little over 3 months when, in a perfect world, it should have taken 9 months to complete, to my weekly freelance work for a Student Accommodation company, their business decimated by the global pandemic, where I try to squeeze in as much work as possible in the 3 hours a week I work for them.

## Google is your friend (and foe)

It's an incredibly obvious tool but I have found myself using Google to resolve a problem almost daily.  I might be knee deep in code, attempting to execute a task and I either can't remember how to do something or it's something completely brand new to me.  Either way, I try not to waste too much time struggling to figure things out for myself, when a Google search can at least put me on the right path towards a solution.

## Don't be afraid to ask for help

## Simple solutions are fast and cost effective... 

But they won't necessarily expand your coding skills.  I affectionately refer to these as "gaffer tape solutions"
